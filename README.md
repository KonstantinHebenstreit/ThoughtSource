# ThoughtSourceâš¡
__A framework for the science of machine thinking__

ThoughtSourceâš¡ is a central, open resource and community around data and tools related to _chain-of-thought reasoning_ in large language models ([Wei 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)). Our long-term goal is to enable trustworthy and robust reasoning in advanced AI systems for driving scientific research and development.

## Roadmap

1. Create a repository of chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets converted to a unified format. âœ…
2. Create a conceptual model of different CoT reasoning styles and errors.
3. Create tools for diagnosing, annotating and evaluating CoT reasoning.
4. Provide models fine-tuned on high-quality CoT data.
4. Apply CoT reasoning to high-impact use-cases such as biomedical research or clinical decision making.

## Current datasets
__Datasets can be [browsed online through the Dataset Viewer ðŸ”Ž](http://thought.samwald.info/)__. 
 
 We created [dataloaders](./libs/dataloader/) that allow you to access the following datasets in a standardized chain-of-thought format. The dataloaders create objects in the [Hugginface ðŸ¤— Datasets format](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).

We are working on collecting and generating additional datasets, and on further improving the quality of existing datasets (see [dataset issues](https://github.com/OpenBioLink/ThoughtSource/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adataset)). We welcome suggestions for the inclusion of other datasets!
